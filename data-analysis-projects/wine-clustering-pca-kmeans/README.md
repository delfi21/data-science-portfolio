\# Wine Clustering Using PCA and K-Means



This project explores the use of unsupervised learning techniques to identify
patterns in wine chemical composition data. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
is applied for dimensionality reduction, followed by K-Means clustering.



\## Methods

\- Data preprocessing and standardization

\- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

\- K-Means clustering

\- Cluster evaluation using elbow and silhouette methods



\## Repository Structure

\- `data/`: dataset used in the analysis

\- `figures/`: key visualizations

\- `Wine_clustering.ipynb`: full analysis notebook

\- `report/`: academic report (Spanish) detailing the methodology and results.





\## Dataset



The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality dataset from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository (ID: 186). The data is loaded directly using the `ucimlrepo` Python package.
