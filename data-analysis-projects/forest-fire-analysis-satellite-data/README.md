\# Forest Fire Analysis Using Satellite Data



\## Overview

This project analyzes a forest fire event using satellite-derived data.

Unsupervised learning techniques were applied to identify spatial and

temporal patterns associated with fire-affected areas.



\## Objectives

\- Analyze satellite data related to a forest fire event

\- Identify clusters using unsupervised learning methods

\- Interpret the results in terms of fire behavior and affected regions



\## Methods

\- Data preprocessing and feature selection

\- K-Means clustering

\- Exploratory data analysis and visualization



\## Tools

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- scikit-learn

\- Matplotlib

\- Seaborn 

## Repository Structure
- `forest-fire-clustering.ipynb`: full regression analysis notebook
- `data/`: directory reserved for data 
- `figures/`: visualizations and diagnostic plots


\## Results

The clustering analysis revealed distinct patterns associated with burned

and non-burned regions, highlighting the usefulness of unsupervised learning

for environmental data analysis.
