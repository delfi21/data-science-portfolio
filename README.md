\# Data Science Portfolio



This repository contains a curated selection of academic and applied projects

in data analysis, statistics, optimization, and machine learning.



The projects were developed during my studies in Data Science and Physics,

with a strong emphasis on quantitative modeling, data-driven reasoning,

and reproducible analysis.
