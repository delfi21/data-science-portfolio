\# Data Science Portfolio



This repository contains a curated selection of academic and applied projects

in data analysis, statistics, optimization, and machine learning.



The projects were developed during my studies in Data Science and Physics,

with a strong emphasis on quantitative modeling, data-driven reasoning,

and reproducible analysis.

\## 📌 About Me



I have a strong quantitative background with training in Physics and

Data Science, and experience working with real data, mathematical models,

and computational analysis.



This portfolio is intended to showcase my approach to problem-solving,

data analysis, and model-based reasoning.
